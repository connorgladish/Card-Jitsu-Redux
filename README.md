A browser-based **fan game** inspired by *Club Penguin's* **Card-Jitsu**. Players can engage in battles, choose cards strategically, and challenge a tougher opponent (Sensei mode) while enjoying a clean, interactive experience.

---

## **About the Game**
This fan-made project recreates the core mechanics of the original **Card-Jitsu** game:
- **Elements**: Fire 🔥, Water 💧, and Snow ❄️.
- **Cards**: Each card has an element and a number (used to break ties).
- **Rules**: 
   - Fire beats Snow.
   - Snow beats Water.
   - Water beats Fire.
   - If the elements match, the higher number wins.

The game adds a fun **progression system** and a special **Challenge Sensei** mode for those seeking a tougher challenge. (YET TO COME)

---

## **Features**
- 🎴 **Dynamic Card Battles**: Players get a new hand of 5 random cards each round.
- 🏆 **Win Conditions**:
   - Collect 3 cards of the **same element**.
   - Collect **all three unique elements**.
- 🔥 **Elemental Effects**: Visual effects like flames, snow, or water splashes for winning moves.
- 🎨 **Customization**: (Planned) Customize your character with different colors and accessories.
- 🎶 **Background Music**: Immersive music with an option to mute/unmute.
- 🐧 **Challenge Sensei**: (Planned) A tougher opponent with strategic gameplay.

2. On the **main menu**, choose:
   - "Start Game" for standard battles.
