# CardJitsu

This is a take on Club Penguin's Minigame "CardJitsu."

Basically, it is rock-paper-scissors.

Fire beats snow, snow beats water, water beats fire.

A win in each element allots a round win.

A win in the same element three times allots a round win.

That's it so far.

It is very early on right now with literally everything.
